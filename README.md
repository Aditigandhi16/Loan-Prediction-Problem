Project Name: Load Prediction

This project aims to predict the server load based on historical data. The predicted load can be used to optimize the resources required to handle the traffic on the server.

Getting Started
*Prerequisites

This project requires the following packages to be installed:
1)Python 3.6 or higher

2)Pandas

3)NumPy

4)Scikit-learn

5)Matplotlib

6)Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Installation
You can install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is included in the data directory. The file train.csv contains the historical server load data.

Running the Code
You can run the code by opening the load_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test data. The predicted load can be used to optimize the resources required to handle the traffic on the server.
